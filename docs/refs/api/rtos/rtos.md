#### RTOS

The Arm Mbed RTOS is a C++ wrapper over the Keil RTX code. For more information about Keil RTX, check [the Keil CMSIS-RTOS tutorial](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS/raw/master/CMSIS/Documentation/RTX/CMSIS_RTOS_Tutorial.pdf) and [the element14 introduction to Keil RTX](https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-46650/l/arm-keil-rtx-real-time-operating-system-overview). You can use these resources as a general introduction to RTOS principles; it is important to be familiar with the concepts behind an RTOS in order to understand this guide.

The code of the Mbed RTOS can be found in the [`mbed-os`](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os) repository, in the [rtos subdirectory](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/tree/master/rtos). The Doxygen is [available here](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os-api/en/mbed-os-5.5/api/group__rtos.html).

#### Default Timeouts

The Mbed RTOS API has made the choice of defaulting to `0` timeout (no wait) for the producer methods, and `osWaitForever` (infinite wait) for the consumer methods.

A typical scenario for a producer could be a peripheral triggering an interrupt to notify an event; in the corresponding interrupt service routine you cannot wait (this would deadlock the entire system). On the other side, the consumer could be a background thread waiting for events; in this case the desired default behaviour is not using CPU cycles until this event is produced, hence the `osWaitForever`.

<span class="warnings">**Warning**: No wait in ISR </br>When calling an RTOS object method in an ISR all the timeout parameters have to be set to 0 (no wait); waiting in ISR is not allowed. </span>

#### Status and error codes

The CMSIS-RTOS functions will return the following statuses:

* `osOK`: function completed; no event occurred.
* `osEventSignal`: function completed; signal event occurred.
* `osEventMessage`: function completed; message event occurred.
* `osEventMail`: function completed; mail event occurred.
* `osEventTimeout`: function completed; timeout occurred.
* `osErrorParameter`: a mandatory parameter was missing or specified an incorrect object.
* `osErrorResource`: a specified resource was not available.
* `osErrorTimeoutResource`:  a specified resource was not available within the timeout period.
* `osErrorISR`: the function cannot be called from interrupt service routines (ISR).
* `osErrorISRRecursive`: function called multiple times from ISR with same object.
* `osErrorPriority`: system cannot determine priority or thread has illegal priority.
* `osErrorNoMemory`: system is out of memory; it was impossible to allocate or reserve memory for the operation.
* `osErrorValue`: value of a parameter is out of range.
* `osErrorOS`: unspecified RTOS error - runtime error but no other error message fits.
