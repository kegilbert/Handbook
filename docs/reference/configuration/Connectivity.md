### Selecting the default network interface

Applications can use the default network interface without directly specifying its type. This requires settings from `mbed_app.json` to work.

Example application code can be as simple as:

```
    NetworkInterface *net = NetworkInterface::get_default_instance();
    if (!net) {
        // There is no default...
    }
    net->connect();
```

Boards that provide only Ethernet connectivity do not require any configuration. The default settings are sufficient. Boards that provide other connectivity options require selecting the default interface type and providing settings for it.

Select the default interface type by using one of the following `target.network-default-interface-type` parameters:

| `target.network-default-interface-type` | Configuration parameters |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `ETHERNET` | nothing |
| `WIFI`     | `nsapi.default-wifi-security`, `nsapi.default-wifi-ssid` and `nsapi.default-wifi-password` |
| `CELLULAR` | `nsapi.default-cellular-sim-pin`, `nsapi.default-cellular-apn`, `nsapi.default-cellular-username` and `nsapi.default-cellular-password`, `nsapi.default-cellular-plmn` |
| `MESH`     | `nsapi.default-mesh-type` |

```
