<h2 id="configuration-drivers">Drivers</h2>

The driver configurations allows for customization of the OS driver layer. Options in this section pertain to hardware IO. You can find additional serial settings for `printf` in the [platform config page](configuration-platform.html). With the exception of `default-serial-baud-rate` these settings do not affect Serial objects.

The following is the complete list of driver configuration parameters, as generated by `mbed compile --config -v`. Please see [the configuration system documentation](configuration.html) for details on how you may use or override these settings.

```
